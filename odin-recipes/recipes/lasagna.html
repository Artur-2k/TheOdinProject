            When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago,
             he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all 
             time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among 
             the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly
             passed away at 53 years old
